R package to import Formula 1 data using the Ergast API

Start your engines! This package aims to provide a simple, consistent syntax to query the Ergast API and get clean data.frames of Formula 1 World Championship data. It includes functions to import lap times, pit stops, qualifying results, race results, and world championship standings. 

I have had a ton of fun playing with these datasets, so I wanted to make it easy for novice and advanced R users alike to get started analyzing Formula 1. I hope you will have as much fun with this data as I have had!

Thank you to Ergast for providing such an awesome API! I am not affiliated with Ergast. Please read [Ergast's terms and conditions](https://ergast.com/mrd/terms/) and make sure you do not use the package in a manner that violates these terms and conditions. Basically, don't use this for commerical purposes or write a loop that makes more than 4 api calls per second.

The package can be installed in R as follows:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("arkraieski/formula1data")
